# ern-movie-list-demo-js-api-implementation-for-class

A demo Electrode Native API JS implementation returning some movies, because the original tutorial repo no longer works. ðŸ™Œ

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add ern-movie-list-demo-js-api-implementation-for-class
``` 

## Why the ridiculous name?

Because `ern-movie-list-demo-api-impl-js` (the pattern recommended by Electrode Native) was flagged as spam by NPM.
